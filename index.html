            <header>What is HTML</header>
            HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. It is a markup language that tells web browsers how to 
            structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML 
            consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or 
            act in a certain way.

        <section class="main-section" id="Tool-requirements">
            <header>Tool Requirements</header>
            <p><b>First off,</b> we must ensure that we have the right tools. Most important, we need an HTML
             editor.
        There are many choices on the market. Here are a handful of the most popular:
        Sublime Text 3<br>
        Notepad++<br>
        Visual Studio Code<br>
        Komodo Editors<br>
        All you need to do is to open your machine’s built-in notepad or whichever editor you downloaded 
        and  start typing in your lines of code. It is important to note that only an editor can be used to type 
        in lines of code, tools like Microsoft Word or Excel cant be used.
        <br>
            <b>Secondly,</b >ensure that you’ve installed a number of different browsers such as Chrome and Firefox in order 
        to preview your upcoming creation.

        <section class="main-section" id="Creating_your_Webpage">
            <header>Creating Your Webpage</header>
            <P>Open a new folder in your documents, inside the folder create a ".html" file e.g index.html<br> 
                Open your index.html file with any HTML editor, where you will find a clean white page on 
                which to write your code and save changes.

                From there you need to layout your page with the different tags, and view the results on a browser.

        <section class="main-section" id="Basic_Construction_of_an_HTML_Page">
            <header>Basic Construction of an HTML Page</header>
            <p>These tags should be placed underneath each other at the top of every HTML page that you create.<br>

                &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; — This tag specifies the language you will write on the page. In this case, 
                the language is HTML 5.<br>
                
                &lt;html&gt; — This tag signals that from here on we are going to write in HTML code.<br>
                
                &lt;head&gt; — This is where all the metadata for the page goes — stuff mostly meant for search 
                engines and other computer programs.<br>
                
                &lt;body&gt; — This is where the content of the page goes.<br>
                
                HTML Structure
                This is how your average HTML page is structured visually.<br>
                &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>
                &lt;html&gt;<br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;head&gt;<br>
               &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;title&gt;<br>
               &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/title&gt;<br>
               &nbsp; &nbsp;  &lt;/head&gt;<br>
               &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;body&gt;<br>

               &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/body&gt;<br>
                &lt;/html&gt;
            </p>
                <p>
                In summary<br>
                 we have the head and body of the work enclosed in the "html" 
                opening and closing tag<br>
                we also have the "title" (which also has a closing tag) enclosed in the
                 "head" opening and closing tag<br>
                 lastly, the contents of the main-work will be contained in the "body" opening and closing
                  tag

        <section class="main-section" id="Element">
            <header>Elements</header>
            <p>There are elements that used to add content to the body of our work.<br>
                 <b>Starting with the "h" element</b><br>
                This has variations from "h1" to "h6" with decresing importance and font-size<br> 
                e.g<br>
                <code>&lt;h1&gt; This is the most important &lt;/h1&gt;</code><br>
                <code>&lt;h2&gt; This is the next in importance &lt;/h2&gt;</code><br>
                Result:<br>
                <code><h1>This is the most important</h1></code>
                <code><h4>This is the fourth in importance</h4></code>
                <b>Next is the "p" element</b> <br>
                This is used to open new paragraphs<br>
                e.g<br>
                <code>&lt;p&gt; This is a new paragraph &lt;/p&gt;</code><br>
                Result:<br>
                <code><p>This is a new paragraph</p></code>
            </p>
            <p>
                Other elements used in the body of our work includes:<br>
                &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt; To make our work appear in italics<br>
                &lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt; To make an underline<br>
                &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; To make our work appear bold<br>
                &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; To also make our work appear bold<br>
                &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt; To place emphasy<br>
                To check for other elements used with texts in html check <a id="more-element" href="#">here</a>
